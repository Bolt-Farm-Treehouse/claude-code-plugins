# Linking Guide

How to discover and create connections between notes in the vault.

## Link Types

### Structural Links
- **supports** — Note A provides evidence or reasoning for Note B
- **contradicts** — Note A challenges or conflicts with Note B
- **extends** — Note A builds on or deepens Note B
- **qualifies** — Note A adds nuance or conditions to Note B
- **example-of** — Note A is a concrete instance of the pattern in Note B
- **prerequisite** — Understanding Note B requires understanding Note A first

### Associative Links
- **related** — Notes share a topic but the relationship isn't structural (use sparingly)
- **analogous** — Notes describe similar patterns in different domains
- **complements** — Notes cover different aspects of the same larger idea

## Quality Rules

- 3 meaningful links > 15 vague ones
- Every link must pass: "Would someone follow this link and learn something?"
- If you can't explain the connection in one sentence, it's probably not worth linking
- Links always go both ways — update both notes

## Format

In each note's `## Related` section:

```markdown
## Related
- [[other-note]] — one sentence explaining the connection
```

## What to Flag

Explicitly call out:
- **Contradictions** — two notes making conflicting claims (HIGH VALUE)
- **Clusters** — groups of 5+ notes that suggest a new MOC
- **Surprises** — unexpected connections across domains

## MOC Updates

After linking, check:
- Does the new note fit an existing MOC? Add it and update the narrative.
- Does a cluster of unindexed notes suggest a new MOC? Propose creating one.
- Don't just add links to a MOC — update the prose that explains how ideas connect.
