Evaluate a piece of content and decide whether it belongs in the Company Brain vault.

## Step 1: Load Discernment Skill

Read the discernment skill and scoring examples to calibrate the evaluation.

## Step 2: Get the Content

If the user provided content directly, evaluate that. If they referenced something, retrieve it first.

## Step 3: Score and Verdict

Score the content across five dimensions (decision content, tribal knowledge, reusability, uniqueness, clarity) and apply override rules.

Present the score breakdown and verdict: ATOMIZE, FLEETING, or SKIP with reasoning.

## Step 4: Act on Verdict

Ask the user if they want to proceed with the recommended action. If atomize, hand off to the process-doc command.
